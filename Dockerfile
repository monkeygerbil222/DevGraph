# DevGraph agent container: watcher + incremental indexer + MCP-ready graph
# + live dashboard, headless (no tray icon — see devgraph/agent/headless.py).
#
# Neo4j runs as its own container (deploy/docker-compose.yml); this image is
# just the Python side. Registered repos must be bind-mounted in (DevGraph
# never scans a path it wasn't explicitly given), and DEVGRAPH_NEO4J_URI must
# point at the Neo4j service/container, not 127.0.0.1.
