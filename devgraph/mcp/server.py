"""MCP server implementation for DevGraph.

Exposes DevGraph's high-level tools (devgraph/mcp/tools.py) over the MCP
stdio transport via the `mcp` SDK's MCPServer, so any MCP-capable client
(Claude Code, etc.) can register this as a server and call tools without
ever writing Cypher. `run_cypher` is only registered when
Settings.enable_run_cypher is true (default off, per Design Brief
Principle 2/4) — it never appears in the tool listing otherwise.

Client handover — how a connecting client discovers what it needs, without
a human copy-pasting a doc into another repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md:
  - `instructions` (below) is sent once at session init; most MCP clients
    fold it into context automatically. Short, load-bearing rules only.
  - Every tool call below carries a docstring (tool-local usage notes) and
    a `ToolAnnotations` hint (`_READ_ONLY`/`_ESCAPE_HATCH` — every DevGraph
    tool queries the graph or reads disk, none write, so a client/host UI
    can treat these calls as safe without confirmation prompts).
  - Two MCP *resources* carry the rest: `devgraph://client-guide` (the full
    prose guide, DEVGRAPH-CLIENT.md's actual content — this is the thing
    that used to only exist as a file a human had to remember to paste
    elsewhere) and `devgraph://tool-catalog` (a machine-readable per-tool
    summary: identifier kind, envelope shape, build phase). A client can
    `list_resources()`/`read_resource()` either one on its own, live, and
    it can never drift out of sync with the actual tool surface since it's
    served from the same process that registers the tools.

Built-in tools take an optional `repo_id`. Omitted, it defaults to this
session's repository (`DEVGRAPH_MCP_REPO`, else the working directory; see
`resolve_session_repo`), which the `instructions` name; a defaulted dict
response carries `repo_id` and a notice. With no session repository the call
errors and lists the registered repositories rather than picking one.

Every tool call is recorded, metadata only (timestamp, tool name, scoped tool
id, origin, duration, success), to a local JSONL store in the DevGraph state directory —
see `record_tool_call` below. It exists because this process is short-lived
and separate from the dashboard's, and the dashboard reads it back over
`GET /api/mcp-telemetry`. Nothing about it leaves the machine.
