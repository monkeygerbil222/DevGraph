"""Telling MCP clients that the session's project tools changed.

`ProjectToolPlane.reload_if_changed` re-serves `devgraph.tools.yaml`; this
module polls it and notifies clients: `notifications/tools/list_changed` to
legacy-protocol clients (whose connection is captured by a middleware, since
it is only reachable from a request) and `ToolsListChanged` on the
subscription bus for `subscriptions/listen` clients. Both are sent; the bus is
a no-op for legacy clients, and modern clients are never captured (their
connections are per-request, so capturing them would leak and duplicate).

Relies on mcp 2.3.0 internals (`_lowlevel_server`, `_subscriptions`,
`ctx.session._connection`); tests exercise each against the real SDK.
