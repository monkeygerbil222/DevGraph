"""Real git log/status for the dashboard's Git history panel.

Backs `/api/repos/{repo_id}/git-log` and `/api/repos/{repo_id}/git-status` --
replaces the prototype's hardcoded commit list. Field names/conventions
mirror `indexer/git_history/extractor.py` (`hexsha`, `message.strip()`,
`author.name`, `authored_datetime`) since that's the existing convention for
reading commits in this codebase.

Every function opens its own `Repo` (via `devgraph.git_safe.open_repo`) in a `with` block -- GitPython holds
open file handles into `.git/` for the life of a `Repo` object, and leaving
one open blocks its directory from being removed/renamed on Windows.
