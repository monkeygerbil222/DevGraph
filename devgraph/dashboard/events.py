"""In-process pub/sub for pushing live graph-change events to SSE clients.

One `asyncio.Queue` per connected browser tab. `publish()` is the only
method called from outside the dashboard's own event loop -- the tray's
health-check thread and the watcher's debounce-timer threads call it
directly (see `agent/sync.py`'s `RepoSync` and `agent/tray.py`'s
`_check_registry_changes`),
never the dashboard loop thread. `asyncio.Queue` is not thread-safe, so
`publish()` never touches a queue directly; it schedules the actual
`put_nowait` onto the dashboard loop via `call_soon_threadsafe` (a plain
callback, not a coroutine -- `run_coroutine_threadsafe` would work too but
is unnecessary machinery for a call that never needs to await anything).
