"""Dashboard-shaped read queries against `GraphEngine`.

Kept separate from `graph/engine.py` (general-purpose upsert/delete API) and
from `mcp/tools.py` (MCP tool response shapes) since these are read queries
built specifically for the dashboard's UI: a stat grid, a Cytoscape.js
node/edge payload, and a lightweight search-box row shape. Every query is
hard-scoped to `repo_id`, same discipline as the rest of the codebase (see
Design Brief Principle 3).
