"""Indexer dispatch: routes a repo's changed/deleted files to the right
extractor and upserts (or removes) their graph output.

This is the orchestration layer the Implementation Plan's watcher/indexer
sections describe but that never got wired up: `devgraph add`/`rescan`, the
watcher's on_changes callback, and the tray app all now go through
`index_paths`/`remove_paths` here instead of leaving extractors as
importable-but-unwired Python functions.

Dispatch is purely by file name/extension — no path outside what the caller
passes in (already registry-scoped by construction: callers only ever pass
paths from RepoRegistry-backed watchers or a walk rooted at a registered
repo's own `record.path`).
