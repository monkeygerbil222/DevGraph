"""Decoding a source file's bytes for extraction.

Every extractor works on text, and a byte it can't decode must not cost an
identifier: `def café()` in a Latin-1 file read as UTF-8 with replacement
characters became `caf`. The order, for every file:

1. Python only: the PEP 263 coding declaration on line 1 or 2, when it names
   a codec that decodes the file.
2. UTF-8.
3. cp1252 (Windows "ANSI", the commonest undeclared non-UTF-8 source).
4. Latin-1, which decodes any byte, so nothing is ever replaced.
