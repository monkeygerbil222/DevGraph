"""Tree-sitter-based C# source-code extractor.

Mirrors `devgraph/indexer/python/extractor.py`'s shape (Implementation Plan
#8, row 2): parses a C# file and extracts:
  - Module (the file itself)
  - Class nodes for `class`/`record`/`struct` declarations, with base
    classes AND implemented interfaces both emitted as EXTENDS (the C#
    grammar's `base_list` doesn't distinguish a base class from an
    implemented interface, so — like Python's CALLS name-based over-linking
    — this over-links rather than under-links; a guessed EXTENDS target that
    turns out to be an interface simply never gets more than a name/no
    inheritance-depth semantics attached to it).
  - Function nodes for methods AND constructors (C# doesn't have free
    functions the way Python does; "Function" here means any method-shaped
    member — a constructor's own `name` field is literally the class name,
    so no special-casing is needed to key it sensibly).
  - CONTAINS relationships (Module->Class, Class->Function).
  - XML doc comments (`/// <summary>...</summary>`) immediately preceding a
    class/method/constructor, extracted the same way Python's docstring
    extraction feeds `description`/`docstring_full`.
  - CALLS edges, name-based exactly like Python's `_callee_simple_name`.
  - IMPORTS edges from `using` directives, via a namespace-to-folder
    convention guess (weaker than Python's dotted-import guess — see
    `_using_target` below for why).

Known scope cuts (documented, not silently dropped):
  - `interface` declarations are not emitted as Class nodes (brief allows
    skipping when "implementing interfaces" isn't easy to do precisely;
    tree-sitter-c-sharp's `base_list` doesn't distinguish interfaces from
    base classes at all, so doing it "properly" would need semantic type
    info this extractor doesn't have). Interface names still appear as
    EXTENDS targets from an implementing class's base_list — they just never
    resolve to a real Class node, which is the same non-materializing-guess
    behavior IMPORTS targets get.
  - Local functions (`local_function_statement`) and lambda bodies are not
    extracted as their own Function nodes and are not treated as CALLS
    scope boundaries — calls inside a lambda are attributed to the
    enclosing method (matching Python's own lambda behavior, since a Python
    lambda isn't a `function_definition` node either); calls inside a local
    function ARE excluded from the enclosing method's CALLS (the walk stops
    descending at `local_function_statement`, same treatment as a nested
    `def`), they're simply not attributed anywhere.
  - Top-level statements (C# 9+ `Program.cs` style, code with no enclosing
    class) are not modeled — there's no enclosing Function/Class to attach
    CALLS to, and this is a rare style in mid-size/library code, which is
    what the golden-repo parity bar targets.
  - Cross-project (`.csproj` reference) resolution is out of scope per the
    Implementation Plan's table for this language.

    Thin wrapper matching `python/extractor.py`'s `index_file` signature and

        repo_id: Repository ID for scoping.
        file_path: Path to the C# file to index.
        repo_root: The repository's root directory. When given, the Module
            node is keyed by file_path's path relative to repo_root (forward
            slashes) — same rationale as the Python extractor: prevents
            same-named files in different directories from colliding into
            one Module node. Falls back to the bare filename when omitted.
