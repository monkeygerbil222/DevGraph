"""Tree-sitter-based C++ source-code extractor.

Handles both C++ source files (.cpp/.cc/.cxx) and headers (.h/.hpp) with one
extractor — headers and sources share the same grammar, and the same
class/function/include shapes, so there is no reason to split them.

Scope, per Implementation Plan #8's per-language table: **structural parity
only, not import-graph parity.** Module/Class/Function/CONTAINS/EXTENDS/CALLS
extraction follows the same name-based philosophy as the Python extractor
(see `devgraph/indexer/python/extractor.py`'s `_callee_simple_name`). IMPORTS
extraction is deliberately weak: `#include` resolution has no reliable
general algorithm without a real build system (compiler include paths, `-I`
flags, precompiled headers, vcpkg/conan layouts, etc.), so:

  - `#include "local.h"` (quoted form) gets the same "guessed same-repo
    relative path, never materializes an edge if wrong" treatment Python's
    dotted-import guessing uses (`upsert_relationship` only MATCH-links real
    existing nodes, so a wrong guess is simply inert).
  - `#include <system.h>` (angle-bracket form) is **not resolved at all** —
    skipped entirely. These are almost always system/standard-library/
    third-party headers with no repo-relative meaning, and guessing a
    same-repo path for them would be actively misleading rather than merely
    unresolved.

This means the resulting IMPORTS graph for a C++ repo will be thin compared
to Python's (quoted-include-only, same-directory-guess-only) — that is
expected and documented, not a bug. See Implementation Plan #8's Open Item 3.

C++ has no module-level docstring convention analogous to Python's leading
string-literal (no equivalent of a triple-quoted string as the first
statement of a file), so Module nodes carry no `description`/
`docstring_full` here — only Class/Function nodes do, from an immediately
preceding `///` (one or more consecutive line comments) or `/** ... */`
block comment.

C++ namespaces are flattened: a `namespace ns { ... }` body's declarations
are walked as if they were directly in the enclosing scope (Module, or the
enclosing class for a nested namespace inside a class — vanishingly rare).
The graph schema has no Namespace node type to model in Plan #8's scope, and
Python's own package/module structure already carries the equivalent
information at the file level, so this matches the "parity, not innovation"
bar rather than inventing a new node type C++ alone would use. Preprocessor
conditionals (`#ifdef`/`#ifndef`/`#if`/`#else`/`#elif`) are flattened the
same way, since `preproc_ifdef` etc. wrap their body as direct named
children in Tree-sitter's cpp grammar — this lets include-guarded headers
(the overwhelming majority of real-world .h files) parse normally instead of
losing every declaration inside the guard.

Out-of-class method definitions (`ClassName::MethodName(...) { ... }`,
common in .cpp files that implement a class declared in the matching .h)
are attributed to Class ClassName via a text split on '::' on the qualified
declarator (e.g. 'Outer::Inner::method' -> class 'Inner', method 'method';
'A::~A' -> class 'A', method '~A') — the segment immediately before the
final name, not the leftmost one, since the leftmost segment is more likely
to be an enclosing namespace than the class itself. This is a textual
heuristic, not a semantic one: it does not require (or verify) that a class
named 'Inner' was actually declared in this same file. When it wasn't (e.g.
the class lives in a header this file doesn't happen to also be extracting
in the same batch), a minimal stub Class node is still emitted so the
Function's CONTAINS edge has a real endpoint to MATCH onto — Neo4j's
`SET n += properties` merge (see GraphEngine.upsert_nodes) means this stub
never clobbers the fuller Class node the header's own extraction writes,
regardless of which file is indexed first or second.
