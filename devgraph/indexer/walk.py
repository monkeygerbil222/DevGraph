"""Which files under a repository the indexer may read.

Shared by the dispatcher, the watcher, the schema providers and doctor, so
each scopes files the same way without importing the dispatcher.

The walk leaves out the directories named in `IGNORED_DIR_NAMES` and
whatever the repository's .gitignore files ignore (see `gitignore`). Which
walked files are worth extracting is judged by their content, separately
(`content_skip_reason`): a schema provider still represents a large or
binary file, such as an image.
