"""Git history extractor for Phase 3.

Walks a repo's commit log via GitPython, incrementally (only commits newer
than the registry's `last_indexed_commit` for that repo_id), and creates
`Commit` nodes linked `MODIFIES` to the `Module` nodes for files each commit
touched. This is purely local (reads the repo's own `.git`) — no network
calls, unlike PR/issue ingestion.

`Module` targets are matched by file path against Module.name as set by the
Python indexer's `index_file` (which uses the file's name/relative path as
the Module node's name) — a MODIFIES edge only materializes if that Module
node already exists (same constraint as every other cross-extractor edge in
this codebase; see indexer/python/extractor.py's index_file for precedent).
