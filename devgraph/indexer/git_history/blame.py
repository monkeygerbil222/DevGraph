"""Blame-based recency for Function/Class nodes.

Maps `git blame`'s per-line commit attribution onto a file's already-indexed
Function/Class line ranges, giving `last_modified_at`/`last_modified_by` at
function/class granularity without a `git log -L` call per function (see
Implementation Plan #7 for why `created_at` at this granularity is out of
scope for this pass — blame only tells you who last touched a line, not when
it was first written).
