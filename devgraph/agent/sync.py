"""Keeps the graph in step with what the watcher reports, for the tray and the
headless agent alike: live batches, catch-ups, stamps and failure floors
(spec W5, W7, W9).

`last_indexed` is the start of the work it covers. While a batch for a
repository has failed, every stamp is held back to the repository's *floor*:
the last good stamp before the failure (a live batch's events can predate its
start by as long as it waited on the batch lock). A catch-up from the floor
is requested; a catch-up from at or before the floor that succeeds clears it.
