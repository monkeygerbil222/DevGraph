"""DevGraph tray app: the always-on shell around watcher + incremental indexing
+ Neo4j health + the live web dashboard.

A thin shell per the Implementation Plan — it owns startup/shutdown wiring
and surfaces health via the tray icon, but the registry/watcher/graph
components underneath are what do the real work. No filesystem path is ever
touched here directly; everything routes through RepoRegistry/WatcherManager.
Also starts the dashboard (devgraph/dashboard/) on its own daemon thread, per
Implementation Plan #5 — a second, independent read-only consumer of the
same GraphEngine/RepoRegistry this app already owns.

Does NOT run the MCP server: DevGraph's MCP server uses the stdio transport
(devgraph/mcp/server.py), which is inherently 1:1 with a single client's
stdin/stdout — an MCP client (e.g. Claude Code) spawns that process itself
per DEVGRAPH-CLIENT.md, rather than the tray app hosting a shared server
process. The tray app's job is keeping the graph itself current.
