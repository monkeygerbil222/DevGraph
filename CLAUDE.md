# Working agreement

See [README.md](README.md) for what this project is and [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for current state — don't duplicate either here.

- Read before writing: check existing code/docs for the answer before asking or assuming.
- Minimal diffs: prefer targeted edits over rewrites; don't refactor beyond the task.
- No speculative abstraction, error handling, or config for cases that can't occur.
- Match established conventions in the surrounding code; if none exist, choose deliberately — it sets the pattern.
- Keep README.md, design docs, and status docs current when behavior changes; don't let them drift into fiction.
- Never commit real names, personal paths, or identifying data — use fictional examples.
- Never add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or similar self-referencing) trailer to commit messages, and don't mention Claude/the assistant by name in commit messages, PR descriptions, or code comments unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Two trackers, split by purpose. Human-facing issues live upstream on
`HaydenSchmidtDOC/DevGraph`; Fourthought coordination state lives on the fork
`monkeygerbil222/DevGraph` and is written only by the coordinator. Never create a
Fourthought record upstream. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
