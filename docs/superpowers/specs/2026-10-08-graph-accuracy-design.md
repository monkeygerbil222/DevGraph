# Graph accuracy: wrong, stale and missing edges — design

Upstream epic: HaydenSchmidtDOC/DevGraph#1. Four bugs that reviewers' fuzzing
and real-client runs found. Each one exists on upstream `master` and on this
branch. The watcher-correctness fuzz listed bugs 2–4 as pre-existing
(PROJECT_STATUS, the watcher paragraph); bug 4 is the "Remaining gaps"
cross-batch referrer gap. Revised after a code-checked review (two live-confirmed
criticals: edge ownership and shared-node recreation).

## Problem

Each bug was reproduced with a scratch repository, `full_scan`, `index_paths`
and `remove_paths` against the local Neo4j. The edges below are
`label:name@file`.

| # | Bug | Reproduction | Wrong graph |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Same-named functions in different files steal each other's call edges | `src/app.py`: `helper()` and `main()` calling `helper()`; `src/worker.py`: `main()` returning `2`; `full_scan` | an extra `Function:main@src/worker.py -CALLS-> Function:helper@src/app.py` |
| 1b | A call, base class or import removed from a file keeps its edge, even after `full_scan` | `m.py` with `class K(Base)` and `main()` calling `helper()`; edit both away; `full_scan` | `Class:K@m.py -EXTENDS-> Class:Base@m.py` and `Function:main@m.py -CALLS-> Function:helper@m.py` survive |
| 2 | A service removed from `compose.yaml` stays, even after `full_scan` | `compose.yaml` with `api` (`python:3.12`) and `db` (`postgres:16`); drop `db`; `index_paths`, then `full_scan` | `Service:db@compose.yaml`, `Container:postgres` and `db -RUNS-> postgres` survive |
| 3 | A mention removed from Markdown keeps its `MENTIONS` edge, even after `full_scan` | `notes.md` mentions `` `helper` `` and `` `other` ``; edit to mention only `` `other` ``; `index_paths`, then `full_scan` | `Document:notes.md -MENTIONS-> Function:helper@app.py` survives |
| 4 | Deleting and restoring an import target loses `IMPORTS`/`CALLS` | `pkg/a.py`: `from pkg.b import helper`, `main()` calls `helper()`; `remove_paths(pkg/b.py)`, then restore and `index_paths(pkg/b.py)` | `Module:pkg/a.py -IMPORTS-> Module:pkg/b.py` and `Function:main@pkg/a.py -CALLS-> Function:helper@pkg/b.py` missing. The same happens when `lib/b.py` is added after `pkg/a.py` imports it. A `full_scan` heals this one. |

Bug 1b is not in the reported list. It was found while reproducing bug 1,
and it is why bug 1 can't be healed by a rescan alone. Docs notes have the
same flaw: a `links`/`supersedes`/`decided_by` entry removed from a note keeps
its edge. That is now in scope (G2).

## Root causes

1. **The edge source is matched by bare name.**
   `_emit_call` (`devgraph/indexer/python/extractor.py:416-436`) emits
   `CALLS` with `from_file=None`. `_upsert_relationships_tx`
   (`devgraph/graph/engine.py:462-481`) then matches the source as
   `(a:Function {repo_id, name})`. That pattern matches every `main` in the
   repository, so each file's calls are written from every same-named
   function. The same holds for:
   - `EXTENDS` (`python/extractor.py:518-526`);
   - `CONTAINS` from a parent *function* to a nested one
     (`python/extractor.py:569-579`, where `from_file` is set only for a
     `Class` parent);
   - the same three emit sites in each of the other seven code extractors
     (`jsts`, `java`, `csharp`, `cpp`, `go`, `rust`, `kotlin`).

   The handover's "deliberate over-linking" refers to the *target* end,
   because a callee can live anywhere. The source end is a node of the file
   being parsed, except in one case: a Rust `impl Trait for Foo` (and a Go
   method) can sit in a different file from `Foo`. That makes the source a
   by-name reference too.
2. **A re-index never retracts edges.** This is the shared cause of 1b, 2,
   3 and the docs-note flaw.
   - **Code files (1b).** `_replace_file_nodes_tx`
     (`engine.py:493-517`) deletes only the file's nodes that are no longer
     extracted, then MERGEs the rest. A surviving node keeps every outgoing
     edge it ever had.
   - **Compose files and Containerfiles (2).** `_index_compose_file` and
     `_index_containerfile` (`devgraph/indexer/dispatch.py:1635-1646`) go
     through `_upsert_container_result` (`dispatch.py:1673-1693`), which
     only upserts.
   - **Markdown mentions (3).** `mentions.extractor.index_file`
     (`devgraph/indexer/mentions/extractor.py:387-400`) only upserts.
     PROJECT_STATUS's claim that "a rescan drops them" (for skip mode) is
     therefore wrong.
   - **Docs notes.** `docs.extractor.index_file`
     (`devgraph/indexer/docs/extractor.py:182-215`) only upserts.

   An edge carries nothing about who wrote it, so a retraction can't be
   scoped safely by the edge's source node. A docs note writes
   `Module -DOCUMENTED_BY-> note`, out of a code file's Module. `conv.rs`
   writes `Foo -EXTENDS-> Display`, out of `foo.rs`'s `Foo`. A compose file's
   `Service` gets `USES` edges from Python files. The reviewer confirmed
   live that a source-scoped retraction deletes the first two.
3. **The re-claim recreates shared nodes.** `_replace_file_nodes_tx` calls
   `_unclaim_source_tx(file)` (`engine.py:161-180`) for every claim the file
   holds. A node that only this file claims is `DETACH DELETE`d, then
   re-created by the upsert, which loses its incoming edges (`MENTIONS`,
   `Service -USES->`). The Python branch already does this to its
   `Datastore`/`Endpoint` claims on every save, because `_index_datastores`
   and `_index_apis` write them *after* the replace. G3 would add compose
   `Container`s to the same path.
4. **Nothing finds code referrers of an added node (4).**
   - `remove_paths` → `delete_nodes_by_source_file` (`engine.py:46-51`)
     `DETACH DELETE`s the removed file's Module and symbols, together with
     every incoming `IMPORTS`/`CALLS`/`EXTENDS`.
   - When the file comes back, `_expand_with_reverse_dependents`
     (`dispatch.py:1047-1090`) follows only *existing* `IMPORTS` edges, and
     there are none left.
   - `_find_referrers` (`dispatch.py:1125-1152`) knows only docs notes,
     handler stubs and same-directory JVM subtypes.
   - "Added" is decided by `(label, name)` (`list_file_nodes`,
     `engine.py:1026-1047`). A symbol that moves between files in one batch
     is therefore not "added", even though every edge to its new node is
     missing.

## Decisions

| # | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| G1 | **Pin the source end, and stamp the writer.** A shared helper, `own_edges(result, file_path)` in `devgraph/indexer/common.py`, does two things. It sets `from_file = file_path` on every relationship whose source `(label, name)` is one of `result.nodes` with `properties.file == file_path`. It also sets `origin = file_path` (the writer, which G2 adds to the edge's `origins`) on every relationship. All eight code extractors call it before they return. A Module source is never pinned: it has `source_file`, not `file`, and its name is already the path. A source that isn't a file-scoped node of this file is never pinned either: the C++ out-of-class `Class` stub, or a Rust/Go type defined elsewhere. Target ends stay bare-name matched (over-linking by design). |
| G2 | **Ownership is "edges this file wrote", kept as a sorted `origins` list on the edge.** `GraphRelationship` and the rel dicts gain `origin` (the writing file). `_upsert_relationships_tx` adds it to `r.origins` with a sorted insert, in Cypher with no APOC: `[x IN coalesce(r.origins, []) WHERE x < row.origin] + [row.origin] + [x IN coalesce(r.origins, []) WHERE x > row.origin]`, skipped when it is already listed or `row.origin` is null. A multi-writer edge (two Python files of one service using one store) is therefore deterministic. Every built-in extracted-edge writer passes `origin`: the code extractors (G1), compose and Containerfile, the Python owning-service and API passes, docs notes, mentions, and the G5 relink (the referrer's path). **One retraction primitive, *unclaim edge*:** remove `$f` from `r.origins`, where an edge with no `origins` (legacy) counts as `[$f]` (`coalesce(r.origins, [$f])`), and delete the edge when the list is empty. It is applied to four anchored, `repo_id`-scoped edge sets, each in the transaction of the write that follows. **(a) Owned sources:** `(a)-[r]->()` where `a` is owned by the file (`a.file = F OR a.source_file = F OR (a:Module AND a.name = F)`). This runs in the same single scan as the stale-node delete in `_replace_file_nodes_tx`. **(b) Foreign sources:** before the Module is overwritten, the replace reads its *old* `name_ref_sources` (G5). It unclaims edges `(a {repo_id, name IN old_sources})-[r]->()` with `$f IN r.origins`. No legacy rule applies here: a legacy edge isn't attributable. Such an edge is healed by (a) on its source's file during the upgrade rescan, and then re-written with `origins` by its real writer in pass 2. This is how `conv.rs` dropping `impl Display for Foo` retracts. **(c) The Python service and API pass:** `(:Service {repo_id})-[r:USES]->()` and `(:Endpoint {repo_id})-[r:CALLS|IMPLEMENTS]->()`, unclaimed for a Python file's replace with the legacy rule. The owning-service edges are re-added in `index_paths`' final service pass, after every batch file is indexed. Between the file's replace and that pass, a reader can briefly miss them; this is accepted and commented, because the pass must see the whole batch's compose files. **(d) Docs notes:** `replace_doc_note(repo_id, file_name, nodes, rels)` anchors on `(n:Requirement|DesignDecision|ArchitectureNote {repo_id: $repo_id, source_file: $f})`, the labels the docs extractor writes, so it scans only notes. It unclaims the incoming `DOCUMENTED_BY`/`SATISFIES` into those nodes and the outgoing `SUPERSEDES`/`DECIDED_BY` from them, with the legacy rule, then upserts. Every docs-note edge touches the note's own node, so this is complete. It is never a cross-repo or unanchored scan. `delete_nodes_by_source_file` (file deletion) applies (b) and (c) before its `DETACH DELETE`, so a deleted file's foreign and service/API edges lose that file's origin too. Edges another file wrote out of an owned node keep their own origins and survive: `DOCUMENTED_BY`, a Rust `impl` edge, `Service -USES-> Datastore`. Edges with no built-in writer are never touched: provider, filesystem, `MODIFIES`, `RESOLVES`. |
| G3 | **Compose files and Containerfiles go through `replace_file_nodes`, and a replace re-claims instead of recreating.** `_upsert_container_result` calls `engine.replace_file_nodes(repo_id, rel_path, nodes, rels)`. `_unclaim_source_tx` gains `keep`: the `(label, name)` pairs of claimed nodes (no `file`, with `source == F`) in the new extraction. It drops only the claims that are gone, and the upsert then rewrites the kept claims' properties through `_claim_nodes_tx`. `delete_nodes_by_source_file` passes no keep (everything goes). The Python branch moves its `Datastore`/`Endpoint`/handler-stub node writes and its API relationships into the same `replace_file_nodes` call (extract first, write once), so a single-claimant `Datastore` keeps its `MENTIONS`. Compose writes only `Container` and `Service` nodes: `Volume`/`Network` are extracted but never upserted, and so are their `USES` edges. |
| G4 | **A full mentions re-index replaces the Document's `MENTIONS`.** `GraphEngine.replace_mentions(repo_id, file_name, nodes, rels)` (the same signature as `replace_file_nodes`) deletes `(:Document {name: file_name})-[:MENTIONS]->()` and writes the nodes and edges in one transaction. `index_file` uses it when `names is None`. The relink (`names=...`) stays additive. `replace_file_nodes` is not reused: it would delete a docs note at the same path as stale. |
| G5 | **Relink by-name edges when a batch adds their endpoint.** Three Module properties are written at extraction, always, as an explicit empty list when there is nothing to record. `name_refs` is the file's by-name edges as sorted, de-duplicated strings joined by `\x1f`: `rel_type, from_label, from_name, from_file, to_label, to_name, caller_class`. "By-name" means `to_file` is unset, or the source is an unpinned code symbol (`schema.FILE_SCOPED_LABELS`); a route's pinned `IMPLEMENTS` (G8) is not, since the route file writes both its ends. `name_ref_targets` is their sorted distinct `to_name`s. `name_ref_sources` is the sorted distinct `from_name`s of unpinned non-Module sources. These properties are written only by the pass-1 replace; the pass-2 node re-upsert omits them. "Added" is keyed by `(label, name, file)`, with the same `file` on both sides. `list_file_nodes` returns `coalesce(n.file, n.source_file, n.path)`, or `n.name` for a Module. `_batch_nodes` uses: a code node's `properties.file`, or the path for its Module; for a docs note, the note's repo-relative path (`path.relative_to(root).as_posix()`, not the `path.name` its extraction is keyed with), matching the `source_file` that `index_doc_file` writes; for a `Document`, its repo-relative path; for a compose `Service`, the compose file (`batch_services` becomes `(label, name, rel_path)` triples); and for a provider node, its `path`. After pass 2, `index_paths` runs one read: Modules outside the batch and outside the `_find_referrers` files whose targets or sources meet the added names. The read returns `[e IN m.name_refs WHERE split(e, $sep)[5] IN $names OR split(e, $sep)[2] IN $names]`, with `$sep = "\x1f"` passed as a query parameter (no Cypher escape), with the list-property name filter applied first. Python keeps the entries whose `(to_label, to_name)`, or unpinned `(from_label, from_name)`, matches an added node, and upserts them with `origin = m.name`. The end that matched is pinned to the added node's `file` when its label is file-scoped (`Class`/`Function`/`Service`, `schema.FILE_SCOPED_LABELS`, renamed from the private `_FILE_SCOPED_LABELS` for this); other labels, and the other end, stay bare. An added handler stub has `file` "", and an end pinned to "" matches only the file-less node of that name. A bare-name match can't use the `(repo_id, name, file)` index, so pinning takes the benchmark from 30 s to under 1 s, and it loses no edge: the referrer's edges to same-named nodes that already existed were written when it was indexed, or relinked when they were added. Old `name_ref_sources` also anchor G2(b). No file is read, and there is no cap. `full_scan` skips G5 (`index_paths(..., relink_outside=False)`), because it has no files outside the batch. |
| G6 | **Hidden and reserved.** `name_refs`, `name_ref_targets` and `name_ref_sources` join `RESERVED_NODE_PROPERTIES` and `INTERNAL_NODE_PROPERTIES`, like `claims`. `INTERNAL_NODE_PROPERTIES` (`graph/schema.py`) is the one hidden list: `describe_node` hides it, and the dashboard's node inspector hides what the schema route serves as `hidden_properties`. |
| G7 | **Automatic upgrade.** `INDEX_FORMAT = 2` in `dispatch.py` (3 since route `IMPLEMENTS` were pinned, G8, so the same upgrade drops their cross-file edges). `full_scan` stamps `Repository.index_format = INDEX_FORMAT` when it finishes. `index_outdated(engine, repo_id)` is true when the Repository node's `coalesce(index_format, 1)` is below the constant. Three places act on it. `SchemaRescanScheduler.run_once` treats an outdated repository like a pending schema, but with no quiet period: it runs `full_scan` under `run_exclusive` and calls `on_rescanned`. `catch_up` runs `full_scan` instead of the incremental pass when the index is outdated, so the agent's start catch-up upgrades too. `devgraph status` lists every active repository with an outdated index as "rescan pending". No user action is needed: the first rescan stamps origins, drops the wrong and stale edges, and fills `name_refs`. The scheduler checks `index_outdated` again inside `run_exclusive`, so it skips a repository the start catch-up (or a dashboard registration) upgraded while it waited on the batch lock. A repository with no `last_indexed` (never indexed) is not outdated to the scheduler or `status`: its first scan belongs to `devgraph add`/`rescan`, which may be running in another process and stamps the format when it finishes. |
| G8 | **A handler stub claims only file-less nodes.** `_claim_nodes_tx` matches `(n:{label} {repo_id, name}) WHERE n.file IS NULL`, and creates the node when there is none, instead of `MERGE (n:{label} {repo_id, name})`. A route's handler stub is therefore its own file-less `Function`, whichever file is written first, and never claims another file's (or its own file's) `def search()`. A FastAPI or Flask `Endpoint` `IMPLEMENTS` the stub and its own file's `Function` of that name (the handler `def` follows its decorator), with `to_file` set to the route file and to "" (the file-less stub); a same-named `Function` in another file gets no edge. A Django `Endpoint`, whose view is usually imported from `views.py`, still `IMPLEMENTS` every `Function` of that name by bare name until imports are resolved. Fresh and incremental scans agree. A handler that loses its route decorator loses the stub with it (the unclaim deletes the stub's last claim), so the real `Function` never carries `type: handler`, `source`, `sources` or `claims`. Other claimed labels (`Datastore`, `Endpoint`, `Container`) never have a `file`, so nothing changes for them. |

## Interactions checked

- **Watcher batch semantics.**
  - G2 runs inside each file's pass-1 transaction, and pass 2 re-creates
    in-batch edges as before.
  - A docs note and a code file it links to can be in the same batch. The
    note's edge lists only the note in `origins`, so the code file's replace
    can't delete it, and the note's docs pass re-writes it.
  - G5 runs after pass 2. A delete-then-restore split across two batches (a
    git checkout or a branch switch) is exactly its case.
  - A symbol moving between files within one batch is "added" under
    `(label, name, file)`. The mentions relink and `_find_referrers` get the
    pair projection of that set. A moved symbol therefore also gains the
    `MENTIONS` that a fresh scan gives it. Docs entries that `_read_docs_batch`
    reports as `existing` (field-keyed, moving between files) are still not
    "added".
- **Shared-node attribution.**
  - G2 never matches a claimed node: it has no `file`/`source_file`.
  - G3 keeps kept claims' nodes in place, re-attributed by `_claim_nodes_tx`,
    and deletes a node only when its last claim goes.
  - `Service -USES-> Datastore` and `Endpoint -CALLS-> Service` list the
    Python files that wrote them, so a compose re-index keeps them. When one
    of two writers stops writing, or is deleted, the edge stays with the
    other writer; it goes with the last.
- **Docs provider.**
  - Provider edges are non-built-in types, written without `origins` out of
    provider nodes, and every G2 set is anchored on built-in nodes or types,
    so no retraction matches them.
  - Provider edges into code nodes are incoming edges.
  - `_relink_docs` is unchanged.
- **Mentions.** The relink adds the doc to `origins`, as the full index does.
  Skip mode: adding a second node with an already-mentioned name still
  leaves the old edge until the doc is re-indexed (G4 now drops it then) or
  rescanned.
- **Cost.** `name_refs` was 348 KiB as JSON for `cli/main.py`. The compact,
  de-duplicated form drops the keys, `repo_id` and repeats. It is written
  once per file save and never re-upserted in pass 2. The G5 read filters
  Modules on the short name lists before splitting any entry. A benchmark
  pins the read at about 5,000 Modules.

## Out of scope (known gaps, recorded in PROJECT_STATUS)

- **Same-file sibling collisions** (file+scope identity) and IMPORTS-based
  call precision. These are the handover's open items 1 and 2.
- **A compose-only batch that adds `build:`.** It gets no owning-service
  `USES`/`CALLS` until the owned Python files are re-indexed. The fuzz
  excludes it.
- **Go/Rust methods defined in another file than their type.** Their
  `CONTAINS` is pinned to the method's file, where the type doesn't live,
  so it is never created (fresh and incremental alike). The C++
  out-of-class method has the same gap: its `CONTAINS` comes from a
  file-less `Class` stub, under a `from_file` the stub doesn't have.
- **C#/TS partial classes.** Each file's `partial class Foo : Base` is its
  own node, so `EXTENDS` hangs off the declaring file's node only (noted in
  `HANDOVER_node_identity.md`).
- **Recency and `MODIFIES` after delete-and-restore.** This still needs
  `devgraph rescan --full`.
- **Deletions don't relink.** For example, a skip-mode ambiguous name stays
  unlinked after the duplicate goes.
- **A docs note whose `id` changes in place leaves the old-id node.** A
  `full_scan` doesn't heal it either. The fuzz never changes a note's `id`.
- **A docs note moved to another path, indexed there before the old path is
  removed** (two batches: the new file, then the deletion). The note's node
  takes the new `source_file`, so the removal no longer matches it, and its
  edges keep the old path in `origins`. An edge the new file later stops
  writing then survives. A single batch (a rename seen as one change) and a
  `full_scan` are correct. The fuzz removes a renamed note's old path first
  when it splits a batch.

## Docs to update

- **PROJECT_STATUS.**
  - In "Remaining gaps", drop the `IMPORTS`/supertype/`CALLS` cross-batch
    gap.
  - In the watcher paragraph, drop the three "Pre-existing bugs found by the
    watcher fuzz".
  - Correct the skip-mode sentence.
  - Say the index upgrade is automatic (G7), and list "Out of scope" above.
- **`HANDOVER_node_identity.md`.**
  - Sources are pinned; only targets are bare-name.
  - Edges carry a sorted `origins` list.
  - The C#/TS partial-`EXTENDS` note.
- **Docstrings.** `GraphRelationship` (`common.py`), and `index_paths` and
  `_find_referrers` (`dispatch.py`).
