# Database & memory stats — design

Upstream issue: HaydenSchmidtDOC/DevGraph#3. PR #19 already delivered live JVM
heap via `GET /api/database-stats`. This spec covers the rest: the other stats a
stock Neo4j 5.26 Community container can actually provide, store size on disk,
and a short sampled history so the card can show trends.

## Goals

- Every number on the Database & memory card is a real reading or an explicit
  "unavailable" with a reason — never estimated (the card's existing rule).
- Show memory, CPU, GC and on-disk size for the Neo4j instance DevGraph uses.
- Keep roughly the last hour of samples so a user can see what an index run did
  even if no dashboard tab was open at the time.

## Non-goals

- Page cache hit ratio. Neo4j 5.26 Community exposes no `org.neo4j` JMX beans
  and its metrics subsystem is Enterprise-only; there is no source. The card
  says so instead of showing a dashed meter forever.
- A custom Neo4j image, APOC, or any plugin download (the stack is local-first:
  `NEO4J_PLUGINS=["apoc"]` would download at container start).
- Persisting history across restarts.

## What is available (verified against `neo4j:5.26-community`)

| Reading | Source |
| :--- | :--- |
| JVM heap used/max | `dbms.queryJmx("java.lang:type=Memory")` (existing) |
| System RAM total/free, swap total/free, process + system CPU load | `dbms.queryJmx("java.lang:type=OperatingSystem")` |
| GC collection count and total time | `dbms.queryJmx("java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*")` |
| Configured page cache size | `dbms.listConfig()` → `server.memory.pagecache.size` |
| Store size (graph store vs. transaction logs) | Filesystem walk of the Neo4j data directory |

JMX composite values are nested as `attributes.<Name>.value` (scalars) or
`attributes.<Name>.value.properties.<field>` (composites), as #19 found.

## Architecture

### `devgraph/dashboard/db_metrics.py` (new)

- `collect_snapshot(engine, data_dir: Path | None) -> dict` — one reading, made
  of independent groups, each with its own `available` flag so one failing
  source never blanks the others:
  - `heap` — unchanged shape from #19 (`available`, `used_bytes`, `max_bytes`,
    `used_percent`). The parser moves here from `routes.py`.
  - `system` — `ram_total_bytes`, `ram_free_bytes`, `swap_total_bytes`,
    `swap_free_bytes`, `process_cpu_load`, `system_cpu_load` (0–1 fractions;
    a negative JVM "not available" value becomes `None`).
  - `gc` — `collection_count`, `collection_time_ms`, summed across collectors.
  - `pagecache` — `configured` (the config string as Neo4j reports it, e.g.
    `"512.00MiB"`), `hit_ratio_available: false`.
  - `store` — `graph_bytes` (sum under `databases/`), `tx_log_bytes` (sum under
    `transactions/`), `total_bytes`. Unavailable with reason `"not_configured"`
    when `data_dir` is `None`, `"unreadable"` when the walk fails.
  - `ts` — sample time (epoch seconds).
- Same defensive parsing rules as #19: fixed literal queries, `bool` rejected as
  a number, non-finite rejected, impossible values (used > max, zero totals)
  reported as unavailable.
- `MetricsHistory` — `deque(maxlen=240)` of compact samples (`ts`, heap used,
  RAM used, process CPU, store total), plus `start(interval_s=15)` / `stop()`
  running `collect_snapshot` on a daemon thread. `latest()` returns the most
  recent full snapshot; `since(seconds)` returns compact samples.

### Settings

`neo4j_data_dir: Path | None = None` (`DEVGRAPH_NEO4J_DATA_DIR`). Optional; when
unset, store size is unavailable and the card names the setting.

### Routes (`routes.py`)

- `GET /api/database-stats` returns the latest snapshot (collecting one on
  demand if the sampler has none yet). The `heap` key keeps its current shape,
  so the existing UI and tests keep working. Still always 200, never driver
  error text.
- `GET /api/database-stats/history?seconds=3600` (clamped 60–3600) returns
  `{"interval_s": 15, "samples": [...]}`.

### App lifecycle (`app.py`)

`build_app` creates one `MetricsHistory`, passes it to `build_router`, and
starts/stops it through a FastAPI lifespan handler — so both the tray and the
headless agent get sampling with no changes of their own.

### Deploy

`deploy/docker-compose.yml` mounts the Neo4j data volume read-only into the
agent at `/neo4j-data` and sets `DEVGRAPH_NEO4J_DATA_DIR=/neo4j-data`. No image
changes. `deploy/podman-compose.yml` runs only Neo4j (the agent is the host tray
app), so it gets a comment pointing `DEVGRAPH_NEO4J_DATA_DIR` at the volume's
host path (`podman volume inspect devgraph_neo4j_data --format '{{.Mountpoint}}'`),
which applies only when Podman runs natively on Linux. Under `podman machine`
(Windows/macOS) the volume is inside the VM and not on the host filesystem, so
store size stays unavailable (the card says so) and the other readings are
unaffected. The README documents the same.

## Dashboard (`static/index.html`)

The Database & memory card becomes:

- JVM heap meter + sparkline (existing meter, new sparkline).
- System RAM meter (used/total) + sparkline; swap as a text row.
- CPU (process / system) text row.
- GC: total collections and time.
- Page cache: configured size, with a tooltip that hit ratio needs Neo4j
  Enterprise metrics.
- Store size: total, with graph store vs. transaction logs split + sparkline.
- Note text names whatever is unavailable and why.

The card polls `/api/database-stats` and `/history` every 15 s. Each group is
rendered independently; any missing/invalid group stays dashed. Sparklines are
small canvases drawn with the same plain-canvas approach as the existing query
chart — no new library.

## Error handling

- Neo4j unreachable: every Neo4j-backed group is unavailable; store size can
  still be live (it reads the filesystem).
- If the first (heap) query raises, the remaining Neo4j queries in that
  snapshot are skipped, so an unreachable database costs one driver timeout per
  snapshot, not four.
- A file that disappears during the store walk (Neo4j rotates transaction logs)
  is skipped; any other walk error makes store size unavailable rather than
  reporting an undercount.
- A blank `DEVGRAPH_NEO4J_DATA_DIR` is treated as unset.
- Sampler exceptions are logged at debug and the sample is skipped; the thread
  never dies on a bad read.

## Testing

- `tests/dashboard/test_db_metrics.py`: parsers against recorded 5.26 rows plus
  malformed/denied/empty cases; store walk on a tmp dir (including missing
  dir); ring buffer limits and `since()`; sampler start/stop.
- `tests/dashboard/test_database_stats.py`: extend for the new keys and the
  history route; the existing heap assertions stay as-is.
- UI: extend `database_stats_ui.js` / `test_database_stats_ui.py` for the new
  rows, unavailable states, and sparkline rendering with empty/short history.
- Manual: run the dashboard against the local `neo4j:5.26-community` container.

Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (dashboard section), `README.md` if it lists
settings, and the compose comments for the new mount.
